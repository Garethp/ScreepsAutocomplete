/**
 * Creeps are your units. Creeps can move, harvest energy, construct structures, attack another creeps, and perform other actions. Each creep consists of the following body parts:
 *  - MOVE Cost: 50 Effect: Moves a creep 1 square per tick per 1 other body part
 *  - WORK Cost: 20 Effect: Harvests 2 energy units from a source per tick; constructs a structure for 1 energy per tick; repairs a structure for 10 hits per tick.
 *  - CARRY Cost: 50 Effect: Can contain up to 50 energy units.
 *  - ATTACK Cost: 100 Effect: Attacks another creep/structure with 30 hits per tick in a short-ranged attack.
 *  - RANGED_ATTACK: Cost: 150 Effect: Attacks another creep/structure with 15 hits per tick in a long-ranged attack up to 3 squares long.
 *  - HEAL: Cost: 200 Effect: Heals another creep restoring 10 hits per tick.
 *  - TOUGH: Cost: 20 Effect: No effect
